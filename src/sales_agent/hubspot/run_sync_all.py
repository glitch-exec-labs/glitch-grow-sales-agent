"""One-shot: sync every enriched lead into HubSpot.

Pumps all `status='enriched'` (and beyond) leads into HubSpot Contacts,
Companies, and Deals via the sync layer. Idempotent — re-running picks
up only leads whose `hubspot_synced_at` is older than their `updated_at`,
so a refresh cycle after a re-enrichment is cheap.

For v0 we sync everything that has a non-NULL HubSpot stage map
(`leads.status` ∈ {enriched, scored, drafted, sent, opened, replied,
booked, dead} — i.e., not `new` and not `paused`). Concurrency is
bounded so we never approach the HubSpot 100-req/10s standard-tier
ceiling.

Usage:
    cd /home/support/glitch-grow-sales-agent
    source .venv/bin/activate
    PYTHONPATH=src python3 -m sales_agent.hubspot.run_sync_all
