"""One-shot: replay every historical email_send as a HubSpot engagement.

Used after a HubSpot account swap (or any time email_sends rows have a
NULL hubspot_engagement_id). Pulls every send that's missing an
engagement id, builds a HubSpot Email engagement payload from the
stored snapshot (subject + body + sent_at + from/to), POSTs it, and
links it to the lead's deal + contact via associations.

Idempotent: rows that already have hubspot_engagement_id set are
skipped, so re-runs don't duplicate.

Usage:
    cd /home/support/glitch-grow-sales-agent
    source .venv/bin/activate
    PYTHONPATH=src python3 -m sales_agent.hubspot.run_replay_engagements
