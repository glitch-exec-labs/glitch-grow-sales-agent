"""Cannabis retailer discovery — Greater Toronto Area expansion.

Same architecture as run_north_york: Google Places (New) text search,
dedup on place_id, idempotent upsert into sales_agent.leads. Skips any
shop we already have via LeadRepo.upsert's COALESCE on (source, source_id).

Coverage:
- The 7 surrounding GTA cities (Mississauga, Brampton, Vaughan, Markham,
  Richmond Hill, Oakville, Burlington)
- Deeper sweeps of the Toronto boroughs we have only thin coverage on
  from the North York pass (Etobicoke, Scarborough, East York)

Two query templates per city ("cannabis store" + "dispensary") gives
the widest catch with reasonable API cost — the dedup absorbs overlaps.

Usage:
    cd /home/support/glitch-grow-sales-agent
    source .venv/bin/activate
    PYTHONPATH=src python3 -m sales_agent.discovery.run_gta
