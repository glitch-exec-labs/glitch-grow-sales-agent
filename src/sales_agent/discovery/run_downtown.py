"""Cannabis retailer discovery — Downtown Toronto.

Targets the high-density downtown corridors directly with neighbourhood-
specific queries instead of relying on Google's fuzzy geographic
matching on broader "Toronto" terms (which is what fed Old Toronto
leads into the North York / GTA passes incidentally).

Coverage:
- Generic downtown ("downtown Toronto")
- Major corridors with the highest cannabis-retail density:
  Yonge Street, Queen Street West / Queen West, Kensington Market,
  Liberty Village, King Street West / King West, The Annex,
  Dundas West, Roncesvalles, Leslieville, The Beach, Distillery
- Two query templates per corridor (cannabis / dispensary)

Dedup is automatic via LeadRepo.upsert (source, source_id) — anything
the GTA pass already pulled stays untouched, only new ones land.

Usage:
    cd /home/support/glitch-grow-sales-agent
    source .venv/bin/activate
    PYTHONPATH=src python3 -m sales_agent.discovery.run_downtown
