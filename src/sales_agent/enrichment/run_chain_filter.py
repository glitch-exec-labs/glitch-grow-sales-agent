"""Pre-filter chain-location leads before enrichment.

Cannabis retail in Ontario has a long tail of multi-location chains
(Tokyo Smoke, Spiritleaf, Canna Cabana, Fire & Flower, One Plant,
Sessions, Hunny Pot, FIKA, etc.). At Discovery scale (655+ leads
across the GTA), pulling all their storefronts means doubling the
enrichment cost on shops the drafter scoring already benches out of
the queue (-30 chain keyword + -30 multi-location domain → score < 40).

This pre-filter pauses chain leads BEFORE we hit their websites with
the site detector + contact_finder. It saves ~30 minutes of API calls
+ scrapes per discovery batch and keeps the operator's HubSpot
pipeline view focused on real prospects.

Two detection methods:
1. **Keyword match** — `business_name` contains a known chain
   identifier (single source of truth: `score.CHAIN_KEYWORDS`).
2. **Multi-location domain** — same `website_url` host appears 3+
   times across `status='new'` leads. Catches chains we haven't
   added to the keyword list yet.

Pauses with `paused_reason='chain_location'`. Idempotent: re-running
won't re-pause already-paused rows because the SQL filter is
`WHERE status='new'`.

Usage:
    cd /home/support/glitch-grow-sales-agent
    source .venv/bin/activate
    PYTHONPATH=src python3 -m sales_agent.enrichment.run_chain_filter
