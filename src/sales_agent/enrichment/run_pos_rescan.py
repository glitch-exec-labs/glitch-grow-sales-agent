"""Re-scan every lead to populate `pos_platform`.

Different from `run_enrichment` — that runs once on `status='new'` and
transitions to `enriched`. This is an idempotent rescan that updates
`pos_platform` in place regardless of status, without disturbing the
funnel state. Re-runs are safe.

Usage:
    cd /home/support/glitch-grow-sales-agent
    source .venv/bin/activate
    PYTHONPATH=src python3 -m sales_agent.enrichment.run_pos_rescan
